# LTC2688 Python
These scripts provide an example of communicating with the Analog Devices
LTC2688 and LTC2686 series of parts via Python.  This is based on the Matlab
scripts found [here](https://github.com/BrentK-ADI/MatlabScripts/tree/main/LTC2688)

The scripts assume the [DC590B](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/dc590b.html) or
[DC2026C](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/dc2026c.html) controller board are utilized for the
SPI transactions. Valid target devices are:
- [LTC2688-12, LTC2688-16](https://www.analog.com/en/products/ltc2688.html) - 16-Channel, 12-/16-Bit Voltage Output SoftSpan DAC
    - [DC2873A](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/DC2873A.html) Evaluation Board
- [LTC2686-12, LTC2686-16](https://www.analog.com/en/products/ltc2686.html) - 8-Channel, 12-/16-Bit Voltage Output SoftSpan DAC
    - [DC2904A](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/DC2904A.html) Evaluation Board
